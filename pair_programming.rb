# 3. Finally, change your program so that when the list is printed in the terminal, each food is prefaced with a number, beginning with 1 and going up to 5, for example:

# 1.  cobb salad
# 2.  spaghetti
# 3.  pizza
# 4.  Swedish meatballs
# 5.  mac and cheese

# puts "What are your 5 favorite foods?"

# foods_list = []
# 5.times do 
#   favorite_food = gets.chomp
#   foods_list << favorite_food
# end

# p foods_list

# i = 0
# count = 1
# while i < foods_list.length
#   food = foods_list[i]
#   puts "#{count}. #{food}"
#   i += 1
#   count += 1
# end 

# 1. Create and define a variable count = 0. Using a loop and the += operator, output the following:

count = 0
while count <= 10
  p count
  count += 1
end
